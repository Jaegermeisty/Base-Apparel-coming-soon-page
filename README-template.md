### What I learned

Although this project was relatively simple, there were still a few challenges. One of the trickier parts was ensuring the button, input field, and error image were all properly aligned in the layout. The button had to be positioned well alongside the input, and the error image had to display correctly when needed. It took some time to get the visual feedback for error states to look just right, but it was manageable.

For the JavaScript, I had a similar task earlier, so it was easier for me to implement. It involved form validation and event handling when submitting the email input. While I am still learning JavaScript and some concepts donâ€™t come naturally, the resources available online made it easier to implement the functionality.

Overall, it was a fun project, and I've learned a lot in terms of both layout and scripting. I'm excited to tackle the next challenge and continue improving!

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue improving my understanding of JavaScript, particularly with event handling and DOM manipulation. Although I feel comfortable with basic functionality, I'd like to delve deeper into more complex interactions, such as handling dynamic content and advanced form validation.

Additionally, I plan to refine my knowledge of CSS layout techniques, especially Grid and Flexbox, to build more responsive and sophisticated layouts. While I'm comfortable with the basics, I want to learn how to handle edge cases and improve the performance of my stylesheets.

Lastly, I'm interested in exploring accessibility further, ensuring that all my projects are more inclusive and usable by a wider audience. This includes refining semantic HTML practices and better testing for compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
